# BAIS6060-Baseball
This project was for the Introduction to R Programming class at the University of Iowa. Our group of 3 people decided to create analyses for the 2020 MLB season to see who should be selected to be the MLB NL MVP. This was done using R. Data was sourced from the MLB website, https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/statcast_search
